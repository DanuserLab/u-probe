# Biosensor Processing 3.1
![Alt Text](img/biosensorpkg.jpg?raw=true)

This MATLAB software package allows processing of raw ratiometric biosensor images (for example based on FRET) into fully corrected "ratio maps" or "activation maps" â€” images showing the localized activation of the biosensor. This includes application of all necessary image corrections needed for quantitative widefield imaging of ratiometric biosensors.

New in Version 3.1:
- Added a step to crop a ROI for segementation and its following steps.

New in Version 2.1:
- Added support for movie relocation
- Implemented a graphical interface for preparing data
- Added a preview option when manually thresholding channels
- Added graphical interfaces for the transformation creation and bleedthrough coefficients calculation
- Included the ratio movie creation within the output process
- Fixed various bugs (correction image display...)
