# Biosensor Processing 3.1
![Alt Text](img/biosensorpkg.jpg?raw=true)

## Introduction
This MATLAB software package allows processing of raw ratiometric biosensor images (for example based on FRET) into fully corrected "ratio maps" or "activation maps" â€” images showing the localized activation of the biosensor. This includes application of all necessary image corrections needed for quantitative widefield imaging of ratiometric biosensors.

For more information, please see [Hodgson et al., Curr Protoc Cell Biol. 14.11 (2010).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20235099)
