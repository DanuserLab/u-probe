## Introduction
This MATLAB software package allows processing of raw ratiometric biosensor images (for example based on FRET) into fully corrected "ratio maps" or "activation maps" â€” images showing the localized activation of the biosensor. This includes application of all necessary image corrections needed for quantitative widefield imaging of ratiometric biosensors.

For more information, please see [**Biosensors for characterizing the dynamics of rho family GTPases in living cells**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20235099), *Curr Protoc Cell Biol*, 2010, Chapter 14:Unit 14.11.1-26, written by Louis Hodgson, Feimo Shen, Klaus Hahn.
